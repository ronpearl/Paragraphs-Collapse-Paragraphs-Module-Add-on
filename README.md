# Paragraphs Collapse: Paragraphs Module Add-on
Add-on for the Drupal 8 [Paragraphs Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs). This has been tested on Drupal version 8.2.4 and 8.2.5.

## What Does It Do?
It solves the problem of continually having to scroll down the page when you are using the Paragraphs Module and you have a ton of items added onto each content type. This module extends it by collapsing each entity of the Paragraphs you create. It will also re-format the view to make it more appealing to use.

There is also a configuration for this module to clean up each entity listing so it does not continually say "Type: " as you are viewing each selected entity.

## Installation
Create a folder in your modules folder called "paragraphcollapse", and then put all of these files into that folder. Then go to your Extend page in your Drupal admin section and install it. The name of the module will be "Paragraph Collapse Sections".

Once installed, go back to edit your content type that includes your Paragraphs and enjoy the new view!
