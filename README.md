# Paragraphs Collapse: Paragraphs Module Add-on
Add-on for the Drupal 8 [Paragraphs Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)

## What Does It Do?
It solves the problem of continually having to scroll down the page when you are using the Paragraphs Module and you have a ton of items added onto each content type. This module extends it by collapsing each entity of the Paragraphs you create. It will also re-format the view to make it more appealing to use.

There is also a configuration for this module to clean up each entity listing so it does not continually say "Type: " as you are viewing each selected entity.
